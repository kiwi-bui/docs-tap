# Workload Parameters reference

The supply chains and templates provided by the out of the box packages contain
a series of parameters that customize supply chain behavior. This topic
describes the `workload.spec.params` parameters that are configured in Workload
objects to change their behavior. They are organized by the resource in the
supply chain where they are used.

> **Note** This topic describes parameters you can use to customize the scan
> policy for scanning source code that are related to a resource available in
> the `ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning`. This topic does not cover parameters
> for the `ootb-supply-chain-basic` or `ootb-supply-chain-testing` supply
> chains.

## Source provider

The `source-provider` resource in the supply chain creates
objects that fetch either source code or pre-compiled Java applications
depending how the Workload is configured. See [Building from
Source](building-from-source.hbs.md).

### GitRepository

Use `gitrepository` when fetching source code from Git repositories. This
resource makes further resources available in the supply chain, such as the
contents of the Git repository as a tarball available in the cluster.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>gitImplementation<code></td>
    <td>
      VMware recommends that you use the underlying library to fetch the source code.
      Use either <code>libggit2</code>, required for Azure DevOps, or
      <code>go-git</code>.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: gitImplementation
        value: libggit2
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>gitops_ssh_secret<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the secret in the same namespace as the <code>Workload</code> used for
      providing credentials to fetch source code from the Git repository.
      See <a href="git-auth.html">Git authentication</a>.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: gitops_ssh_secret
        value: git-credentials
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note** It might not be necessary to change the default Git
> implementation, but some providers such as Azure DevOps, require you to use
> `libgit2` due to the server-side implementation providing support
> only for [git's v2 protocol](https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-v2). For information about the features supported by each implementation, see
> [git implementation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/#git-implementation) in the flux documentation.

For information about how to create a Workload that uses a GitHub
repository as the provider of source code, see [Create a workload from GitHub
repository](../cli-plugins/apps/create-workload.hbs.md#-create-a-workload-from-github-repository).

For information about GitRepository objects, see
[GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/).

### ImageRepository

You use ImageRepository when fetching source code from container images. It
makes the contents of the container image available as a tarball to further
resources in the supply chain. The contents of the container image
are fetched by using Git or Maven. See [Create a workload
from local source code](../cli-plugins/apps/create-workload.hbs.md#-create-a-workload-from-local-source-code).

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the service account, in the same namespace as the Workload, you want to use
      to provide the necessary credentials to `ImageRepository` for fetching
      the container images.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

For information about custom resource details, see [ImageRepository reference
docs](../source-controller/reference.hbs.md#imagerepository).

For information about how to use ImageRepository with the Tanzu CLI [Create a workload from local source code](../cli-plugins/apps/create-workload.hbs.md#-create-a-workload-from-local-source-code).

> **Note** `--service-account` flag sets the `spec.serviceAccountName` key in
> the Workload object. To configure the `serviceAccount` parameter, use
> `--param serviceAccount=...`.

### MavenArtifact

When carrying pre-built Java artifacts, `MavenArtifact` makes the artifact available to
further resources in the supply chain as a tarball. You can wrap the tarball as
a container image for further deployment.

Differently from `git` and `image`, its configuration is solely driven by
parameters in the Workload.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>maven<code></td>
    <td>
      Points to the Maven artifact to fetch and the polling interval.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: maven
        value:
          artifactId: springboot-initial
          groupId: com.example
          version: RELEASE
          classifier: sources         # optional
          type: jar                   # optional
          artifactRetryTimeout: 1m0s  # optional
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For information about the
custom resource, see [MavenArtifact reference
docs](../source-controller/reference.hbs.md#mavenartifact).

For information about how to use the custom resource with the `tanzu apps workload` CLI plug-in [Create a Workload from Maven repository
artifact](../cli-plugins/apps/create-workload.hbs.md#workload-maven).

## source-tester

The `source-tester` resource is in `ootb-supply-chain-testing` and
`ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning`. This resource is responsible for instantiating a Tekton [PipelineRun](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelineruns/) object that
calls the execution of a Tekton Pipeline, in the same namespace as the
Workload, whenever its inputs change. For example, the source code revision that you want to test changes.

A [Runnable](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.4.0/reference/runnable/)
object is instantiated to ensure that there's always a run for a particular set
of inputs. The parameters are passed from the Workload down to Runnable's
Pipeline selection mechanism through `testing_pipeline_matching_labels` and the
execution of the PipelineRuns through `testing_pipeline_params`.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>testing_pipeline_matching_labels<code></td>
    <td>
      Set of labels to use when searching for Tekton Pipeline objects in the
      same namespace as the Workload. By default, a Pipeline labeled as
      `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test` is selected, but when using
      this parameter, it's possible to override the behavior.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: testing_pipeline_matching_labels
        value:
          apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test
          my.company/language: golang
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>testing_pipeline_params<code></td>
    <td>
      Set of extra parameters, aside from `source-url` and
      `source-revision`, to pass to the Tekton Pipeline. The Tekton Pipeline
      <b>must</b> declare both the required parameters `source-url` and
      `source-revision` as well the extra ones declared in this table.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: testing_pipeline_params
        value:
        - name: verbose
          value: true
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

For information about how to set up the
Workload namespace for testing with TektonSee, see [Out of the Box Supply Chain with
Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.hbs.md).

For information about how to use the parameters to customize this resource to
test using a Jenkins cluster, see [Out of the Box Supply Chain
with Testing on Jenkins](ootb-supply-chain-testing-with-jenkins.hbs.md).

## source-scanner

The `source-scanner` resource, included solely in
`ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning`, scans the source code
that is tested by pointing a
[SourceScan](../scst-scan/scan-crs.hbs.md#sourcescan) object at the same source
code as the tests.

You can customize behavior for both [CVEs evaluation](../scst-scan/policies.hbs.md) with parameters.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>scanning_source_template<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the ScanTemplate object in the same namespace as the Workload to
      use for running the scans against the source code.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: scanning_source_template
        value: private-source-scan-template
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>scanning_source_policy<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the ScanPolicy object in the same namespace as the Workload to
      use when evaluating the scan results of a source scan.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: scanning_source_policy
        value: allowlist-policy
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

See [Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing and
Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.hbs.md) for details about how to
set up the Workload namespace with the ScanPolicy and ScanTemplate required for
this resource, and [SourceScan reference](../scst-scan/scan-crs.hbs.md#sourcescan)
for details about the SourceScan custom resource.

For information about how the artifacts found
during scanning are catalogued, see [Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu –
Store](../scst-store/overview.hbs.md).

## image-provider

The `image-provider` in the supply chains provides a
container image carrying the application already built to further resources.

Depending on how the Workload is configured, for example, if using [pre-built
images](pre-built-image.hbs.md) or [building from
source](building-from-source.hbs.md), different semantics apply:

- pre-built: an `ImageRepository` object is created aiming at providing a
  reference to the latest image found matching the name as specified in
  `workload.spec.image`

- building from source: an image builder object is created (either Kpack's
  `Image` or Tekton TaskRuns for building images from Dockerfiles)

### Kpack Image

The Kpack Image object provides a means for building a
container image out of source code or pre-built Java artifact. This makes the
container image available to further resources in the supply chain through a
content addressable image reference that's carried to the final
deployment objects unchanged. See [About Tanzu Build
Service](../tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.hbs.md).

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the service account, in the same namespace as the Workload, to use
      for providing credentials to `Image` for pushing the
      container images it builds to the configured registry.

      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For information about how to use Dockerfile-based builds and limits associated with the function, see [Dockerfile-based builds](dockerfile-based-builds.hbs.md).

### Pre-built image (ImageRepository)

For applications that already have their container images built outside
the supply chains, such as providing an image reference under
`workload.spec.image`, an `ImageRepository` object is created to keep track of
any images pushed under that name. This makes the content-addressable name, such as
the image name containing the digest, available for further resources in the
supply chain.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      name of the serviceaccount (in the same namespace as the Workload) to use
      for providing the necessary credentials to `ImageRepository` for fetching
      the container images.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note** `--service-account` flag sets the `spec.serviceAccountName` key in
> the Workload object. To configure the `serviceAccount` parameter, use
> `--param serviceAccount=...`.

For information about the
ImageRepository resource, see [ImageRepository reference
docs](../source-controller/reference.hbs.md#imagerepository).
For information about the prebuild image function, see [Using a prebuilt
image](pre-built-image.hbs.md).

## image-scanner

The `image-scanner` resource is included only in
`ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning`. This resource is responsible for scanning a container image, either built by using the supply chain or prebuilt,
persisting the results in the store, and gating the image from moving
forward in case the CVEs found are not compliant with the ScanPolicy referenced
by the ImageScan object create for doing so.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>scanning_image_template<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the ScanTemplate object in the same namespace as the Workload to
      make use of for running the scans against a container image.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: scanning_image_template
        value: private-image-scan-template
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>scanning_image_policy<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the ScanPolicy object in the same namespace as the Workload to
      make use of when evaluating the scan results of an image scan.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: scanning_image_policy
        value: allowlist-policy
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For information about the ImageScan custom resource, see [ImageScan reference](../scst-scan/scan-crs.hbs.md#imagescan).

For information about how the artifacts found
during scanning are catalogued, see [Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu –
Store](../scst-store/overview.hbs.md).

## config-provider

The `config-provider` resource in the supply chains is responsible for
generating a PodTemplateSpec
to use in app configs, such as knative services and deployments, to
represent the shape of the pods that you want to instantiate to run the
application in containers. See [PodTemplateSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-template-v1/#PodTemplateSpec) in the Kubernetes documentation.

The `config-provider` resource manages a [PodIntent](../cartographer-conventions/reference/pod-intent.hbs.md)
object that represents the intention of having PodTemplateSpec enhanced
with conventions installed in the cluster whose final representation is then
passed forward to other resources to form the final deployment configuration.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      name of the serviceaccount (in the same namespace as the Workload) to use
      for providing the necessary credentials to `PodIntent` for fetching
      the container image to inspect the metadata to pass to convention
      servers and the serviceAccountName set in the
      podtemplatespec.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>annotations<code></td>
    <td>
     Extra set of annotations to pass down to the PodTemplateSpec.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: annotations
        value:
          name: my-application
          version: v1.2.3

      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>debug<code></td>
    <td>
      Put the workload in debug mode.
    </td>
    <td>

> `--param serviceAccount=...`.

See [Cartographer Conventions](../cartographer-conventions/about.hbs.md) to know
more about the controller behind `PodIntent`.

See [Developer
Conventions](../developer-conventions/about.hbs.md) and [Spring Boot
Conventions](../spring-boot-conventions/about.hbs.md) for more details about the two
convention servers enabled by default in Tanzu Application Platform installations.


## app-config

The `app-config` resource is responsible for preparing a ConfigMap with the
Kubernetes configuration that is used for instantiating an application in
the form of a particular workload type in a cluster.

The resource is configured in the supply chain in such a way to allow, by
default, three types of workloads with the selection of which workload type to
apply based on the labels set in the Workload object created by the developer:

- `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web`
- `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: worker`
- `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: server`

Only the `server` workload type has the following configurable parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>ports<code></td>
    <td>
      Set of network ports to expose from the application to the Kubernetes
      cluster.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: ports
        value:
          - containerPort: 2025
            name: smtp
            port: 25
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

three different types of workloads, and [`server`-specific Workload
parameters](../workloads/server.hbs.md#-server-specific-workload-parameters) for a
more detailed overview of the ports parameter.

## service-bindings

The `service-bindings` resource adds
[ServiceBindings](../service-bindings/about.hbs.md) to the set of Kubernetes
configuration files to promote for deployment.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>annotations<code></td>
    <td>
     Extra set of annotations to pass down to the ServiceBinding and
     ResourceClaim objects.

details about API auto registration.

## config-writer (git or registry)

The `config-writer` resource is responsible for performing the last mile of the
supply chain: persisting in an external system (registry or git repository) the
Kubernetes configuration generated throughout the supply chain.

It can do so in three distinct manners:

- publishing the configuration to a container image registry
- publishing the configuration to a Git repository
  - solely by using the push of a commit, or
  - pushing a commit _and_ opening a pull request.

Details about the different modes of operation are found in [Gitops vs
RegistryOps](gitops-vs-regops.hbs.md) with the parameters documented in
place.

## deliverable

The `deliverable` resource is responsible for creatiing a `Deliverable` object
that represents the intention of delivering to the cluster the configuration
that are produced by the supply chain.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the service account (in the same namespace as the Deliverable) to
      use for providing the necessary permissions to create the children
      objects for deploying the objects created by the supply chain to the
      cluster.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note** `--service-account` flag sets the `spec.serviceAccountName` key in
> the Workload object. To configure the `serviceAccount` parameter, use
> `--param serviceAccount=...`.

> **Note** On build clusters where a corresponding `ClusterDelivery` doesn't
> exist, the Deliverable takes no effect (similarly to a Workload without a
> SupplyChain, no action is taken).

## Deliverable Parameters reference

This section describes the parameters that are provided to the
Deliverable object, such as what is set on `deliverable.spec.params`.

The Deliverable is relevant in the context of deploying to a Kubernetes cluster
that the configuration that is produced through the resources defined by
a ClusterSupplyChain:

```
      Workload              (according to ClusterSupplyChain in `build` cluster)

        - fetch source
        - build
        - test
        - scan
        - generate kubernetes config
        - push k8s config to git repository / image registry


      Deliverable           (according to ClusterDelivery in `run` cluster)

        - fetch kubernetes config (from git repository / image registry)
        - apply kubernetes objects to cluster

```

In the following section, you find the reference documentation that relates specifically to the
two resources defined in the `basic` ClusterDelivery part of the
`ootb-delivery-basic` package:

```
source-provider                     fetches kubernetes configuration
    |
    |  kubernetes configuration
    |
app-deploy                          deploys to the cluster the objects in the
                                    kubernetes configuration fetched
```

For information about the ClusterDelivery shipped with `ootb-delivery-basic`,
and the templates used by it, see:

- [Out of the Box Delivery Basic](ootb-delivery-basic.hbs.md)
- [Out of the Box Templates](ootb-templates.hbs.md)

For information about the use of the Deliverable object in a multicluster
environment, see [Getting started with multicluster Tanzu Application
Platform](../multicluster/getting-started.hbs.md).

For reference information about Deliverable, see [Deliverable and Delivery
custom resources](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.5.0/reference/deliverable/).

## source provider

The `source-provider` resource in the basic ClusterDelivery creates objects
that continuously fetches Kubernetes configuration files from a Git repository
or container image registry so that it can apply those to the cluster.

Regardless of where it fetches that Kubernetes configuration from, Git
repository or container image registry, it exposes those files to further resources along
the ClusterDelivery as a tarball.

### GitRepository

A GitRepository object is instantiated when `deliverable.spec.source.git`
is configured to continuously look for a Kubernetes
configuration pushed to a Git repository, making it available for
resources in the ClusterDelivery.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>gitImplementation<code></td>
    <td>
      VMware recommends that you use the underlying library for fetching the
      source code.  Either <code>libggit2</code>, required for Azure DevOps, or
      <code>go-git</code>.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: gitImplementation
        value: libggit2
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>gitops_ssh_secret<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the secret in the same namespace as the <code>Deliverable</code> used for
      providing credentials for fetching Kubernetes configuration files from
      the Git repository pointed at.<br><br>
      For more information, see <a href="git-auth.html">Git authentication</a>.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: gitops_ssh_secret
        value: git-credentials
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> **Note** It might not be necessary to change the default Git implementation
> but some providers, such as Azure DevOps, require you to use `libgit2` due to
> the server-side implementation providing support only for [Git v2
> protocol](https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-v2). For information about the
> features supported by each implementation, see [Git
> implementation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/#git-implementation) in the flux documentation.

For information about how to create a Workload that uses a GitHub
repository as the provider of source code, see [Create a workload from GitHub
repository](../cli-plugins/apps/create-workload.hbs.md#-create-a-workload-from-github-repository).

For information about GitRepository objects, see
[GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/).

### ImageRepository

An ImageRepository object is instantiated when
`deliverable.spec.source.image` is configured to continuously
look for Kubernetes configuration files pushed to a container image registry
as opposed to a Git repository.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the service account, in the same namespace as the Deliverable, you
      want to use to provide the necessary permissions for `kapp-controller` to
      deploy the objects to the cluster.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

For information about custom resource details, see [ImageRepository reference
docs](../source-controller/reference.hbs.md#imagerepository).

> **Note** `--service-account` flag sets the `spec.serviceAccountName` key in
> the Deliverable object. To configure the `serviceAccount` parameter, use
> `--param serviceAccount=...`.

## app deployer

The `app-deploy` resource in the ClusterDelivery is responsible for applying the
Kubernetes configuration that is built by the supply chain, pushed to
either a Git repository or image repository, and applied to the cluster.

### App

Regardless of where the configuration comes from, an
[`App`](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/v0.41.0/app-overview/) object is
instantiated to deploy the set of Kubernetes configuration files to the cluster.

Parameters:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>serviceAccount<code></td>
    <td>
      Name of the service account, in the same namespace as the Deliverable,
      you want to use to provide the necessary privileges for `App` to apply
      the Kubernetes objects to the cluster.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: serviceAccount
        value: default
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>gitops_sub_path<code> (deprecated)</td>
    <td>
      Sub directory within the configuration bundle that is used for
      looking up the files to apply to the Kubernetes cluster.
    </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
      - name: gitops_sub_path
        value: ./config
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

> **Note** The `gitops_sub_path` parameter is deprecated. Use `deliverable.spec.source.subPath` instead.

> **Note** The `--service-account` flag sets the `spec.serviceAccountName` key in
> the Deliverable object. To configure the `serviceAccount` parameter, use
> `--param serviceAccount=...`. For details about RBAC and how `kapp-controller`
> makes use of the ServiceAccount provided to it using the `serviceAccount`
> parameter in the `Deliverable` object, see
> [`kapp-controller`'s Security
> Model](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/v0.41.0/security-model/).
