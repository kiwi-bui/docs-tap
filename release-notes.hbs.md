## <a id='1-4-0'></a> v1.4.0

**Release Date**: January 10, 2023

### <a id='1-4-0-new-features'></a> New features

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-new-features"></a> Tanzu Application Platform

Tanzu Application Platform is introducing a [shared ingress issuer](security-and-compliance/ingress-certificates.hbs.md) for secure ingress communication by
default. [CNRs](cloud-native-runtimes/about.hbs.md), [AppSSO](app-sso/about.hbs.md), and [Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/about.hbs.md)
are using this issuer to secure ingress. In upcoming releases all components will support it eventually.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-nf"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

* Added ability to configure custom Redis storage for an `AuthServer`, using a ProvisionedService-style API.
  See [configuring storage](./app-sso/service-operators/storage.hbs.md) docs for more info.
* Added package field `default_authserver_clusterissuer` that inherits TAP's `shared.ingress_issuer` value if not set.
  See [IssuerURI and TLS](./app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.hbs.md) docs for more info.
* Added `AuthServer.spec.tls.deactivated` (deprecating `AuthServer.spec.tls.disabled`).
* `AuthServer.spec.tokenSignatures` is now a required field.
* In addition to globally trusted CA certificates, granular trust can be extended with `AuthServer.spec.caCerts`.
* LDAP is now a _supported_ identity provider protocol. Learn [more](app-sso/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md#ldap-experimental).
  * LDAP bind validated on `AuthServer` creation, when an LDAP identity provider is defined.
  * Introduced `identityProviders.ldap.url` in `AuthServer.spec`
  * Introduced `identityProviders.ldap.group.search`
  * `identityProviders.ldap.group` now optional in `AuthServer.spec`

#### <a id="1-4-0-cert-manager"></a> cert-manager

- `cert-manager.tap.tanzu.vmware.com` can optionally install self-signed `ClusterIssuer`s.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-nf"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI Plug-ins

#### <a id='scc-plug-in-new-features'></a>Supply Chain Choreographer Plug-in

- Events are now emitted when resources are applied and when their output or health status changes. See [Events reference](scc/events.hbs.md).
- Source Tester stage now includes a link to the Jenkins job when Jenkins is configured for use
  in the supply chain.
- `spec.source.git.url` is added to the Overview section of the Source Provider stage in the
  supply chain.
- Added support to include current and historical Kaniko build logs in the Stage Details section of
  the supply chain when Kaniko is used as the build service in the Image Provider stage.
- Scanning stages now include a `Show Unique CVEs` filter so that the scan results show one CVE
  per ID as opposed to each CVE per package.
  This allows better alignment between the data in the Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in and the
  Security Analysis plug-in.
- **View Approvals** is relocated to the `Config Writer` stage, instead of being a stage by itself.


#### <a id="1-4-0-scst-scan-new-features"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan
- Users no longer need to create a package overlay to enable Grype in offline and air-gapped environments. Refer to our updated [instructions](scst-scan/offline-airgap.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-services-toolkit-new-features"></a> Services Toolkit
- Added new `ClassClaim` API that allows claims for service instances to be created by referring to a `ClusterInstanceClass`. See [Services Toolkit documentation](./services-toolkit/about.hbs.md) for more information.
- Added corresponding `tanzu services class-claims` CLI plug-in command

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-validation-and-scoring"></a> API Validation and Scoring Toolkit

- API Validation and Scoring focuses on scanning and validating an OpenAPI specification. The API specification is generated from the API Auto Registration of Tanzu Application Platform. See [API Validation and Scoring](api-validation-scoring/about.hbs.md) for more information.

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-new-features"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ
- IntelliJ IDEA v2022.2 to v2022.3 is required to install the extension. 
- Developer sandbox has been enabled which allows developers to Live Update their code — as well as simultaneously debug the updated code — without having to turn off Live Update when debugging.
- An Activity pane has been added in the Tanzu Panel which allows developers to visualize the supply chain, delivery and running application pods, displays detailed error messages on each resource and enables developers to describe and view logs on these resources from within their IDE.
- Tanzu workload apply and delete actions have been added to ​IntelliJ.
- Code snippets to create `workload.yaml` and `catalog-info.yaml` files have been added to IntelliJ.

### <a id='1-4-0-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-bc"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Removed `AuthServer.spec.identityProvider.ldap.group.search{Filter,Base,Depth,SubTree}`.
  Introduce `ldap.group.search: {}` instead. If `ldap.group` is defined, and `ldap.group.search` is not defined, then
  the LDAP will be considered to be an ActiveDirectory style LDAP, and groups will be loaded from the user's `memberOf`
  attribute. If `ldap.group` is defined, and `ldap.group.search` is also defined, then it will be considered a Classic
  LDAP, and group search will be done through searching in the `ldap.group.search.base`. Before, there used to be a
  mixed mode, when both searches were attempted every time.
- Removed `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.ldap.server` field.
- Removed field `AuthServer.status.deployments.authServer.lastParentGenerationWithRestart`
- Removed deprecated field `AuthServer.spec.issuerURI`.
  See [IssuerURI and TLS](./app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.hbs.md) docs for more info.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vscode-bc"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- `Tanzu Debug` no longer port forwards the application port (8080).

#### <a id="1-4-0-scst-scan-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- **Deprecated and removed ScanTemplates:**

  Deprecated Grype ScanTemplates shipped with Tanzu Application Platform v1.1 and earlier were
  removed and are no longer supported. Please use Grype ScanTemplates v1.2 and later.

- **Deprecation notice for `docker` field and related sub-fields:**

  The `docker` field and related sub-fields used in Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan are
  deprecated and marked for removal in Tanzu Application Platform v1.7.0.
  The deprecation impacts the following components: Scan Controller, Grype Scanner, and Snyk Scanner.
  Carbon Black Scanner is not impacted.
  For information about the migration path, see
  [Troubleshooting](scst-scan/observing.hbs.md#unable-to-pull-scanner-controller-images).

#### <a id="1-4-0-ipw-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Image Policy Webhook

The Image Policy Webhook component is removed in Tanzu Application Platform v1.4. This component is deprecated
in favor of the [Policy Controller](./scst-policy/overview.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-policy-controller-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller

Policy Controller no longer initializes TUF by default. TUF is required to
support the keyless authorities in `ClusterImagePolicy`. To continue to use
keyless authorities, provide the value `policy.tuf_enabled:
true` by using the `tap-values.yaml` while upgrading. By default,
the public Sigstore The Update Framework (TUF) server is used. To
target an alternative Sigstore stack, specify `policy.tuf_mirror` and
`policy.tuf_root`.

### <a id='1-4-0-security-fixes'></a> Security fixes

This release has the following security fixes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id='1-4-0-scst-grype-fixes'></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Grype

- `python` is updated to `3.7.5-22.ph3`.

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-auto-registration-fixes"></a> API Auto Registration

- Base image updated to use the latest Paketo Jammy Base image.

### <a id='1-4-0-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-auto-registration-ri"></a> API Auto Registration

- API Auto Registration periodically checks the original API specification from the defined location to find changes, and registers any changes into the `API Descriptor`. This triggers reconciliation into the Tanzu Application Platform GUI catalog. This synchronization period or frequency is configurable through the new value `sync_period`. The default value is 5 minutes.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-ri"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Fixed infinite redirect loops for an `AuthServer` configured with a single OIDC or SAML identity provider.
- Authorization Code request rejected audit event from anonymous users log proper IP address.
- `AuthServer` now longer attempts to configure Redis event listeners.
- OpenShift: custom `SecurityContextConstraint` resource is created for Kubernetes platforms versions 1.23.x and below.
- LDAP error logging now contains proper error message.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ri"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI Plug-ins

- **Immediate entity provider backend Plug-in**

  - The entity provider, used mainly by API Auto Registration, now allows a body size of `5Mb` to accept larger API specifications.
  - Respecting the restriction of Backstage for [Entity Provider mutations](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/external-integrations#provider-mutations), whenever an existing entity is intended for a mutation through this plugin, and its origin is a different entity provider, a `409 Conflict` error is returned.

#### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ri"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer Plug-In

- The UI no longer shows the error `Unable to retrieve details from Image Provider Stage` when the
  Builder is not available or configured. It now correctly shows the same error as the CLI,
  `Builder default is not ready`.

### <a id='1-4-0-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- If a workload is deployed onto a namespace by using Live Update, the user must
  set that namespace as the namespace of the current context of their kubeconfig file.
  Otherwise, if the user runs Tanzu Debug it causes the workload to re-deploy.

#### <a id="1-4-0-grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

**Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager might not reveal vulnerabilities:**

For most languages, Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls are made to fetch
dependencies. For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js, Grype uses the
lock files to check dependencies for vulnerabilities.

For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses dependencies
present in the built binaries, such as `.jar` or `.war` files.

Because VMware does not recommend committing binaries to source code repositories, Grype fails to
find vulnerabilities during a source scan.
The vulnerabilities are still found during the image scan after the binaries are built and packaged
as images.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ki"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI Plug-ins
#### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ki"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer Plug-In
- The `Generation` field in the **Overview** section is not updated when a scan policy is amended, however clicking on the `Scan Policy` link will show the most current scan policy details applied to the stage.
- Customizing the `Source Tester` stage in an OOTB supply chain will not show details in the **Stage Details** section.

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-known-issues"></a> Intellij Extension

- The context menu `Describe` action  in the Activity panel fails when used on PodIntent resources with an error:
  ```kubectl describe PodIntent my-app -n my-apps-namespace
  Warning: conventions.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1 PodIntent is deprecated; use conventions.carto.run/v1alpha1 PodIntent instead
  Error from server (NotFound): podintents.conventions.apps.tanzu.vmware.com "my-app" not found

  Process finished with exit code 1
  ```
  When there multiple resource types with the same kind, attempting to describe a resource of that kind without fully qualifying the API version causes this error.

- When switching Kubernetes context, the activity pane doesn't automatically update the namespace, but the workload pane picks up the new namespace. Therefore, the Tanzu panel will show workloads but will not show Kubernetes resources in the center panel of the activity pane. To fix this please restart IntelliJ to properly pick up the context change.

### <a id='1-4-0-deprecations'></a> Deprecations
