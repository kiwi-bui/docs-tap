# Use API Auto Registration

This topic describes how to use API Auto Registration.

>**Note** The run profile requires you to [update the install values](#update-values) before

>might prefer to update them. For information about profiles,
>see [About Tanzu Application Platform profiles](../about-package-profiles.hbs.md#profiles-and-packages).

API Auto Registration requires the following:

1. A location exposing a dynamic or static API specification.

2. An APIDescriptor CR with that location created in the cluster.
You might additionally set up different install values for `api-auto-registration` package or
CORS for OpenAPI specifications.

To configure:

- [different cluster name, Tanzu Application Platform GUI url or CA Cert values for api-auto-registration](#update-values)

- [CORS for viewing OpenAPI Spec in TAP GUI](#cors)

To generate OpenAPI Spec:

- [by scaffolding a new project using App Accelerator Template](#using-app-accelerator-template)

- [in an existing Spring Boot project using springdoc](https://springdoc.org/#getting-started)

To create APIDescriptor CR:

- [using Out Of The Box Supply Chains](#using-ootb-supply-chain)

- [using Custom Supply Chains](#using-custom-supply-chain)

- [using other GitOps processes or Manually](#using-gitops-manually)

## <a id='update-values'></a>Update install values for api-auto-registration package

1. Create `api-auto-registration-values.yaml`.

   To overwrite the default values, create new values, or update the
   `api-auto-registration-values.yaml` file that has the following text boxes:

    ```yaml
    tap_gui_url: https://tap-gui.view-cluster.com
    cluster_name: staging-us-east
    ca_cert_data:  |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIICpTCCAYUCBgkqhkiG9w0BBQ0wMzAbBgkqhkiG9w0BBQwwDgQIYg9x6gkCAggA
        ...
        9TlA7A4FFpQqbhAuAVH6KQ8WMZIrVxJSQ03c9lKVkI62wQ==
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

2. If you installed the API Auto Registration package on its own, not as part of Tanzu Application
   Platform, update the package using the Tanzu CLI:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update api-auto-registration
    --package-name apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com
    --namespace tap-install
    --version $VERSION
    --values-file api-auto-registration-values.yaml
    ```

>**Note** You can also update API Auto Registration as part of upgrading Tanzu Application Platform. See [Upgrading Tanzu Application Platform](../upgrading.hbs.md).

## <a id='using-app-acc-template'></a>Using App Accelerator Template

If you are creating a new application exposing an API, you might use the [java-rest-service](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/java-rest-service)
App Accelerator template to get a pre-built app that includes a
workload.yaml with a basic REST API.
From your Tanzu Application Platform GUI Accelerators tab, search for the accelerator and
scaffold it according to your needs.

## <a id='using-ootb-supply-chain'></a> Use Out-Of-The-Box (OOTB) supply chains

All the Out-Of-The-Box (OOTB) supply chains are modified so that they can use API Auto Registration.
If you want your workload to be auto registered, you must make modifications to your
workload YAML:

1. Add the label `apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/register-api: "true"`.
2. Add a parameter of `type api_descriptor`:

```yaml
  params:
    - name: api_descriptor
      value:
        type: openapi   # We currently support any of openapi, aysncapi, graphql, grpc
        location:
          path: "/v3/api-docs"  # The path to the api documentation
        owner: team-petclinic   # The team that owns this
        description: "A set of API endpoints to manage the resources within the petclinic app."
```

There are 2 different options for the location:

- The default supply chains use knative to deploy your applications. In this
  event the only location information you must send is the path to the API
  documentation. The controller can figure out the base URL for you.
- You can hardcode the URL using the baseURL property. The controller uses a
combination of this baseURL and your path to retrieve the YAML.

Example workload that exposes a knative service:

```yaml
apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: petclinic-knative
  labels:
    ...
    apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/register-api: "true"
spec:
  source:
    ...
  params:
    - name: api_descriptor
      value:
        type: openapi
        location:
          path: "/v3/api-docs"
        system: pet-clinics
        owner: team-petclinic
        description: "A set of API endpoints to manage the resources within the petclinic app."

```

Example of a workload with a hardcoded URL to the API documentation:

```yaml
apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: petclinic-hard-coded
  labels:
    ...
    apis.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/register-api: "true"
spec:
  source:
    ...
  params:
    - name: api_descriptor
      value:
        type: openapi
        location:
          baseURL: http://petclinic-hard-coded.my-apps.tapdemo.vmware.com/
          path: "/v3/api-docs"
        owner: team-petclinic
        system: pet-clinics
        description: "A set of API endpoints to manage the resources within the petclinic app."
```

After the supply chain runs, it creates an `APIDescriptor` custom resource. This resource is what
Tanzu Application Platform uses to auto register your API.
See [APIDescriptor explained](#api-descriptor).

## <a id='using-custom-supply-chain'></a>Using Custom Supply Chains

If you are creating custom supply chains, you can still use API Auto Registration. To write a
supply chain pipeline, use `ClusterConfigTemplate` by the name of `config-template` in
your pipeline. To write a custom task, verify how the template is written to read parameters,
interpret baseURL from Knative Services, and construct APIDescriptor CRs.

In the Delivery pipeline, you must directly create an APIDescriptor custom resource. You must grant
permissions to create the CR from the delivery pipeline.
For information about APIDescriptors, see [Key Concepts](key-concepts.hbs.md).

## <a id='using-gitops-manually'></a>Using other GitOps processes or Manually

Using your GitOps process, or manually, you must stamp out an APIDescriptor CR and apply it in the
cluster you choose. The APIDescriptor needs all the required text boxes to reconcile.

For information about APIDescriptors, see [Key Concepts](key-concepts.hbs.md).

## <a id='cors'></a>Setting up CORS for OpenAPI specifications

The agent, usually a browser, uses the [CORS](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol)
protocol to verify whether the current origin uses an API.
To use the "Try it out" feature for OpenAPI specifications from the API Documentation plug-in, you must
configure CORS to allow successful requests.

Your API must be configured to allow CORS Requests from Tanzu Application Platform GUI. How you
accomplish this varies based on the programming language and framework you are using.
If you are using Spring, see [CORS support in spring framework](https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework).

At a high level, the Tanzu Application Platform GUI domain must be accepted as valid cross-origin by
your API.

Verify the following:

- **Origins allowed** header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: A list of comma-separated values.
This list must include your Tanzu Application Platform GUI host.
- **Methods allowed** header: `Access-Control-Allow-Method`: Must allow the method used by your API.
Also confirm that your API supports preflight requests, a valid response to the OPTIONS HTTP method.
- **Headers allowed** header: `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: If the API requires any header, you
must include it in the API configuration or your authorization server.
